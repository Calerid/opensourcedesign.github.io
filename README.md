2. Using the [Prose Editor][osd-prose]
3. Modifying source code (technical)

## Code & Design The Website

You need some basic ability to use a terminal as well as some knowledge of web
development like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site is built with the following
programming tools:

- [Jekyll][jekyll]
- [Bootstrap][bootstrap]

### Installing

This step requires having a `ruby` development environment and `git` installed
and configured to connect to Github with SSH.

- [Installing Ruby][installing-ruby]
- [Using Github with SSH][github-ssh]

1. Install Jekyll using and other ruby gems

```
sudo gem install bundler
```

2. Fork and clone the main website repository

```
git clone git@github.com:opensourcedesign/opensourcedesign.net
cd opensourcedesign.net/
bundle install
```

3. Run our installer script

This will pull down all of the repositories (jobs, events, etc...) and put them
in there proper place to build our website locally.

```
./scripts/install.sh
```

*Note: you need to be a member of our [GitHub organization][osd-org].*

4. Build the static site & watch for files

```
jekyll serve --watch --config _config.yml,_config-dev.yml
```

### Updating

Updating the various repos can be done with running the this script

```
./scripts/update.sh
```
